The operation buttons can have data- attributes storing what operation they represent

the first number starts at 0; if it is 0, then pressing any nonzero number will replace it

lets display the first number and the operation while entering the second number

When an operation button is pressed:
 - we record the current number as the first number
 - we record the operation, displaying the first number and the operation
 - let them input a new number

Then when the = button is pressed:
 - we perform the operation, and display the result in the input field
 - this means that this resulting number becomes the first number if we press another operation button
>- what if the = button is pressed when we don't have an operation yet?
>>- it shouldn't do anything, leaving our current first number input the same


But if another operation button is pressed instead:
 - we perform the operation, and set the result as the first number, and let them input a new number
 - this is equivalent to pressing =, then pressing an operation button
